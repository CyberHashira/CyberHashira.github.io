Hey there,
</p>

<p class="sometext">
Welcome to the companion webpage for my YouTube channel, CyberHashira. This is a space where you can find notes related to my YouTube tutorials. If you enjoy textual references, these notes might be just what you're looking for. While updating videos directly can be a challenge, these notes offer a flexible way to share the latest information with you. I'll ensure they stay current and make updates whenever necessary. Alongside the notes, this webpage offers a carefully selected list of links, leading to various RFC pages, documents, and related articles. For developers out there, there are sample codes that might help clarify certain concepts.

And by the way, you'll also find some insights on topics I haven't had the chance to dive into in my videos. If you think this stuff is as cool as I do and want to stay updated, just hit that subscribe button. Every new subscriber keeps the channel rolling and the content coming. Cheers to learning and growing together in the world of cryptography!
